The 2025 Index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment, as AI’s influence across society, the economy, and global governance continues to intensify. New in this year’s report are in-depth analyses of the evolving landscape of AI hardware, novel estimates of inference costs, and new analyses of AI publication and patenting trends. We also introduce fresh data on corporate adoption of responsible AI practices, along with expanded coverage of AI’s growing role in science and medicine. Since its founding in 2017 as an offshoot of the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence, the AI Index has been committed to equipping policymakers, journalists, executives, researchers, and the public with accurate, rigorously validated, and globally sourced data. Our mission has always been to help these stakeholders make better-informed decisions about the development and deployment of AI. In a world where AI is discussed everywhere—from boardrooms to kitchen tables—this mission has never been more essential. The AI Index continues to lead in tracking and interpreting the most critical trends shaping the field—from the shifting geopolitical landscape and the rapid evolution of underlying technologies, to AI’s expanding role in business, policymaking, and public life. Longitudinal tracking remains at the heart of our mission.

            "According to the information provided in the text, it seems that the usage of ChatGPT among teachers and students varies widely. Specifically, Figure 7.2.16 in Chapter 7 of the AI Index report shows that in 2024, only 70% of K-12 computer science and AI teachers spent one to two hours per week using AI tools, with 30% reporting no use at all. This suggests that many teachers in this field are not heavily relying on ChatGPT or other AI tools in their teaching practices. On the other hand, the same figure also reveals that 42% of students aged 18-24 reported using AI-powered products and services every day in 2024, while 79% said they had used them in the past month. These numbers suggest that students are more likely to be actively engaging with AI technologies, including potentially ChatGPT, outside of the classroom setting. However, without further details or context, it's difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the extent or nature of ChatGPT usage among teachers and students specifically.\n",

Among high school students, 56% said they had used or were currently using ChatGPT, while 44% said they had not. These numbers suggest that while ChatGPT is being adopted by some educators and students, there is still a significant portion who are not yet using it. However, it's worth noting that the survey was conducted in 2024, so it's possible that these numbers have changed since then.

However, it's worth noting that year-over-year comparisons for this question are challenging due to differences in survey categories in previous years. Nonetheless, when the 2024 categories are aggregated and compared to the 2023 results, the overall sentiment appears largely unchanged. This suggests that while AI is expected to significantly impact the labor market in the coming years, the exact nature and extent of that impact is still being studied and understood.\n",

Additionally, 60% of respondents believe that AI is likely to change how they do their job during this timeframe. These findings suggest that AI will have a significant impact on the labor market over the next five years, potentially leading to job displacement in some areas as AI becomes increasingly integrated into various industries and tasks. However, it's worth noting that the same poll found that 63% of respondents believe that AI will create new jobs in the future, indicating that there may also be opportunities for workers to transition into new roles as AI adoption accelerates. Ultimately, the precise nature and extent of AI's impact on the labor market over the next five years remain uncertain, but it's clear that AI will continue to transform the way people work and interact with technology in the coming years.\n",

            "According to a global opinion poll conducted by Ipsos in 2024, 36% of respondents believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to replace their current job within the next five years. Additionally, 60% of respondents believe that AI is likely to change how they do their job in the next five years. These findings suggest that AI will have a significant impact on the labor market over the next five years, potentially leading to job displacement in some areas as AI becomes increasingly integrated into various industries and tasks. However, the same poll also found that 23% of respondents believe that AI will not at all likely replace their current job in the next five years, indicating that the impact of AI on the labor market may vary widely depending on the specific industry and job type.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Drug Discovery: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, such as clinical trials, genomic databases, and electronic health records (EHRs), to identify new drug candidates, predict their efficacy, and reduce the time and cost required for drug development. For example, in 2021, Pfizer announced that it had used AI to identify a potential treatment for COVID-19, which was subsequently tested in clinical trials.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Medical Imaging: AI can assist radiologists and other healthcare professionals in interpreting medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound scans, by providing more accurate and detailed results than traditional methods. This can result in earlier disease detection, more personalized treatments, and reduced risks associated with false positives or false negatives. For instance, in 2020, Google's DeepMind AI system achieved human-level performance in detecting breast cancer from mammograms, which could potentially save lives by enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Clinical Decision Support: AI can provide physicians with real-time decision support tools that can help them make more informed and accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. These tools can analyze patient data, such as symptoms, medical history, test results, and genetic information, to provide personalized recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. For example, in 2021, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, developed an AI model that can predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis, a potentially fatal condition caused by infection, inflammation, and organ dysfunction, up to six hours before symptoms appear.\n",
